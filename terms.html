  <h2>7. AI Disclaimer</h2>
  <p><strong>AI May Be Inaccurate:</strong> StyleTally uses artificial intelligence to analyze outfits and provide style recommendations. AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies, errors, or subjective interpretations. The analyses, scores, and suggestions are algorithmically generated and should not be considered absolute or professionally verified fashion advice.</p>
  <p><strong>For Inspiration and Entertainment:</strong> StyleTally's AI features are designed for personal style exploration, inspiration, and entertainment purposes. They are meant to assist you in developing your own style sense, not to replace professional styling services.</p>
  <p><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> The style analysis, color recommendations, and outfit scores provided by StyleTally do not constitute professional fashion advice, personal styling services, or any form of expert consultation. StyleTally is not liable for any decisions you make based on AI-generated recommendations.</p>
  <p><strong>No Guarantee of Outcomes:</strong> We make no warranties or guarantees about the accuracy, completeness, or applicability of AI-generated content to your specific circumstances. Results and user satisfaction may vary significantly.</p>

  <h2>8. AI Personality & Tone Selection</h2>
  <p><strong>User-Selected Tone:</strong> StyleTally offers multiple AI personality options (Bailey, Hana, Charlie, Prada, Rex, Blair, Vogue), each with distinct communication styles ranging from gentle and supportive to direct and critical. You choose your preferred AI advisor and tone.</p>
  <p><strong>Content May Be Blunt or Humorous:</strong> Some AI personalities provide frank, blunt, or humorous feedback. This stylistic choice is intentional and user-selected. If you prefer gentler feedback, you may switch to a different AI personality at any time in your settings.</p>
  <p><strong>Not Intended to Harass or Harm:</strong> While certain AI personalities use more direct language, StyleTally's content is never intended to harass, bully, or cause psychological harm. The feedback is focused on fashion choices, not personal attacks.</p>
  <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> By selecting a specific AI personality tone, you acknowledge and accept the communication style associated with that choice. You assume responsibility for your selection and agree that StyleTally is not liable for any offense taken from AI-generated responses in your chosen tone.</p>

  <h2>9. User Content & License</h2>
  <p><strong>Ownership & Permissions:</strong> You must own or have explicit permission for all photos you upload to StyleTally. By uploading images for outfit or color analysis, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to submit such content.</p>
  <p><strong>Processing License:</strong> When you upload images for analysis, you grant StyleTally a limited, temporary license to process those images solely for the purpose of generating style feedback, outfit scores, and color recommendations. This license exists only for the duration necessary to provide the requested analysis.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Uploaded images are processed to generate results and are not stored permanently on our servers. StyleTally does not use your uploaded content for marketing, training AI models on your personal data, or any purpose beyond providing you with the analysis service.</p>
  <p><strong>Right to Remove:</strong> StyleTally reserves the right to remove any content that violates these terms, including images that depict minors, contain nudity or obscene content, infringe on third-party rights, or violate applicable laws.</p>
  <p><strong>You Retain Ownership:</strong> You retain full ownership of all images and content you upload. StyleTally does not claim ownership of your personal photos.</p>

  <h2>10. Subscription & Digital Access</h2>
  <p><strong>Access vs Ownership:</strong> StyleTally subscriptions grant you access to premium features and content, not ownership. You are purchasing the right to use premium functionality for the duration of your active subscription. Upon cancellation or termination, access to Pro features will cease.</p>
  <p><strong>No Refunds Outside Store Policy:</strong> All subscription purchases are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Refunds are subject to the respective store's refund policy. StyleTally does not directly process refunds. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact Apple or Google support.</p>
  <p><strong>Account Suspension for Abuse:</strong> StyleTally reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, including but not limited to: fraudulent payment activity, account sharing, circumventing free tier limits, abusive behavior, or misuse of the service. No refunds will be provided for accounts terminated due to Terms of Service violations.</p>

  <h2>11. AI-Generated Advice</h2>
  <p>Style analysis and advice provided by StyleTally is generated by artificial intelligence and is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional fashion, personal styling or any other form of professional advice. Results may vary.</p>

  <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content within StyleTally, including the app design, flashcard content, AI personality characters, and fashion educational material, is the intellectual property of StyleTally and is protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws.

  <h2>19. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Such provisions shall be deleted without affecting the remaining provisions herein.</p>

  <h2>20. Waiver</h2>
  <p>The failure of StyleTally to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of StyleTally.
